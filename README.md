Solution for "Remove linked list elements"

# Linked List Node Removal

This code provides a solution for removing nodes from a linked list that have a specific value. The "Solution" class contains a method called "removeElements", which takes the head of a linked list and an integer value as parameters. It removes all nodes in the list that have a value equal to the specified value and returns the new head of the modified list.

# ListNode Class

The "ListNode" class represents a single node in the linked list. Each node has two attributes: "val", which stores the node's value, and "next", which is a reference to the next node in the list.

# Solution Class

The "Solution" class contains the "removeElements" method, which implements the node removal logic. Here's how it works:

1. A dummy head node is created and initialized with a value of -1. This dummy head node serves as a placeholder to handle edge cases without special treatment for the actual head of the list.

2. The "next" attribute of the dummy head node is set to the original head of the linked list, effectively making it the first node in the modified list.

3. The "current_node" variable is initialized with a reference to the dummy head node. It will be used to traverse the list.

4. A "while" loop is used to iterate through the linked list until the end is reached.

5. Inside the loop, the code checks if the value of the next node (current_node.next.val) is equal to the specified value. If it is, that means the next node should be removed from the list.
6. To remove the node, the next reference of the current node is updated to skip the node to be removed, effectively removing it from the list.
7. If the value of the next node is not equal to the specified value, the current_node is updated to the next node, progressing through the list.
8. Once the loop finishes, all nodes with the specified value have been removed from the list.
9. Finally, the code returns dummy_head.next, which represents the new head of the modified list. Since the original dummy head node was not removed (as its value is -1), the new head is the node following the dummy head.


This code provides an efficient solution for removing nodes from a linked list with a specific value. By using a dummy head node and updating the node references, the code avoids special treatment for the head of the list and simplifies the node removal process.
